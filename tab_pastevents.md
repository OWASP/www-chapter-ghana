#### CTF for Developers:

OWASP Ghana Chapter is pleased to announce the 2019 OWASP Ghana CTF
Tournament for Application Developers.

CTF (Capture The Flag) is a type of computer security competition.
Contestants are presented with a set of challenges and puzzles which
test their creativity, technical coding (and googling) skills, and
problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories
and when solved, each yields a “flag” which is submitted to a real-time
scoring service. The difficulty levels are from beginners to advanced.
CTF tournaments are a great and fun way for software developers to learn
a wide array of cyber security / application security skills in a safe
and legal environment. Most programming languages supported. IMPORTANT:
Please bring your own LAPTOP and a charger for it to this event

This CTF environment is kindly provided by [Secure Code
Warrior](https://securecodewarrior.com/).
